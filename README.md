Python AWS Backup
================

Simple Python backup script for backing up files on Amazon S3

Testing
------------
* Make sure you have the config.yaml filled out before you run the test.
* Script comes with test dir and files.


```
 pdfs/dummy.pdf
```
```
dirs = [
        './pdfs'
        ]
```        
Requirements
------------

This script requires boto. To install boto simply run -

```
pip install boto3
```

Configuration
-------------

The script requires the following configuration parameters

**AWS**

Before you can begin using the script, you should set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the IAM Console. You can create or use an existing user. Go to manage access keys and generate a new set of keys.

If you have the AWS CLI installed, then you can use it to configure your credentials file:
```
aws configure
```
Alternatively, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/credentials:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```
You may also want to set a default region. This can be done in the configuration file. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/config:
```
[default]
region=us-east-1
```
Alternatively, you can pass a region_name when creating clients and resources.

This sets up credentials for the default profile as well as a default region to use when creating connections. See Credentials for in-depth configuration sources and options.

**Directories**

You can backup as many directories as you like. Simply define it as a list and include the full path, e.g.

```
dirs = [
        '/path/to/dir',
        '/path/to/dir',
        ]
```

Crontab
-------

Sample cron to run backup every day at 23.00.

```
0 23 * * * python ~/scripts/aws_backup.py
```
